# _**whatsong-backend**_

This is the backend for [_**whatsong**_](https://github.com/NateFuller/WhatSong) I've started building using Vapor. During my development, I have been using one of Vapor's db-management frameworks called [Fluent](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/) to respond to requests in order to add to, remove from, and update an underlying SQLite database.
